# TechAcademyUnrealProjects
This repository contains my individual projects that I completed during my C++ and Unreal Engine Course at the Tech Academy. The UnrealProjects folder contains the actual programs I made using Unreal 4, while the Challenges and CalculatorTutorial folders house my C++ console applications.
